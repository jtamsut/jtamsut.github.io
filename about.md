Hello there! My name is Jonathan Tamsut and I'm a software engineer! Welcome to my blog! This blog is a place where I *teach myself* things I'm interested in. This type of learning is largely inspired by the [Feynman method](http://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model).

I am interested in most aspects of computing, especially software design, computer security and machine learning. I also have interests in mathematics and physics. Currently I spend most of my time writing JavaScript and Ruby code, building web applications.

When I'm not constructing software or writing for this blog I enjoy running, playing and watching soccer and reading non-fiction.

If you'd like to contact me please E-mail me!
