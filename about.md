Hey! My name is Jonathan Tamsut. I'm a software engineer. Welcome to my blog! This
blog is a place where I *teach myself* things I'm interested in. This type of learning
is largely inspired by the [Feynman method](http://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model). 

I am interested in most aspects of computing, especially software design, computer security and machine learning. I also have interests in mathematics and physics.

If you'd like to contact me please e-mail me using the e-mail address below!
