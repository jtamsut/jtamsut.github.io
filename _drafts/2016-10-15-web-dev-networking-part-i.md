# A Fundamentalist Approach to Browsers and the Internet

Simple explanation of how the Internet works: https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/code-org/internet-works/v/the-internet-wires-cables-and-wifi



(ADD AN ALGORITHMS OF THE WEB CHAPTER)

The Internet provides the infrastructure through which people can access web applications. A typical user of a web application interacts with a web application via a web browser. This web browser is a piece of software installed on someone's computer that provides a user with the interface to be able to interact with a web application.

Many people feel compelled to learn the hottest technologies but this somewhat dry topic is important. The way the Internet works on a fundamental level needs to be understood.

In order to built web applications well you must understand the system for which you are designing applications for. This article will discuss how web browsers work as well as how data is transfered over the Internet.

HTTP verbs
HTTP headers and body


HTTPS

This chapter will discuss in some details how web browsers and the Internet works. The World Wide Web and the Internet are two different things.

The Internet is a massive network of networks. It is a networking infastructure. Information that travels over the Internet does so in a variety of languages called protocols.

The World Wide Web is a way of accessing information over the Internet. The web uses the HTTP and HTTPS protocols to communicate. The Web also uses Internet browsers to make requests over the Internet.

Critical Rendering Path

DNS

- DNS (Domain Name System) is the networking system in place that allows us to resolve human-friendly names to unique addresses
- a domain is the human-friendly name that we associate with a URI
- an IP address is a network addressable location

When first learning web development you begin by writing code. You first learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You then may graduate to manipulating the DOM in a more sophisticaed manner using jQuery. Next if continue the JavaScript route you will learn how to create a server in Node and Express.js. You then may even learn a front end framework like Angular, React or Backbone. Lastly, you ma learn how to persist data using a database.

This article will explore the fundmantals of the web. How the web works, how a browser interacts with the web and how a browser interacts with Internet.

## The Browser

Browsers have a huge codebase.

How do you compile browser code?

JavaScript Interpreter -> Chrome uses V8
Let's talk about the V8 engine JavaScript interpreter.

Browser persistence: cookies

Rendering engine: responsible for parsing HTML and converting it to pixels on the screen. Each browser uses a different rendering engine process for each tab.

### URLs vs URIs

A URL is a key part of a browser's ability to retrieve resources from the world wide web. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and is a unique address for a resource on the web. In theory, each URL should point to a uniqur resource.

A URL is made up of multiple parts:

1. Protocol: This indicates what protocol the browser must use to make the request successfully.
  * ftp :
2. Domain name:
3. Port number:
4. Path
5. Paramters:
