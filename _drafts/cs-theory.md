Computer Science Fundamentals

Goal: To build an expert foundation in computer science that will enable you to be a 10x’er. This is a guide that in explicit detail lays out the subjects, content and relevant material needed to learn these topics. This will be a concerted, long-term and organized effort in which the best environment and workflow will be created.

Rules:
- use the minimum number of resources to learn a topic: It is not about how many books you OWN on a topic, it is about how many books you READ on a topic
- find a quiet place to work: go to the library on Ocean Park Blvd.
- keep focused
- do not consume a resource because it is there; consume a resource because it is the best way for you to learn that topic
- BE LEAN WITH LEARNING MATERIALS
- make the solving problems about that topic : reading about that topic ratio high
- do deep work on that topic -> work in 2 hour chunks of uninterrupted focus
- make a timeline for everything you do and keep to it
