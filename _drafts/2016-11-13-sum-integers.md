This article outlines a general solution that gives the sum of a finite series of positive integers.

# The Problem

Giving the finite series where the terms are the natural numbers, give a general
expression for computing the sum of terms. The series in question can be represented as

    1, 2, 3, 4 ... n

Suppose we have a number n and we would like to calculate the sum of the integers from
1 to n with single integer steps. So for example for n = 3,
