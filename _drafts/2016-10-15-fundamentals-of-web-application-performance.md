latency - the time from source sending packet to the destination receiving it
bandwidth

a router is responsible for relaying a message between a client and server

aspects of latency:
- propogation delay
- transmission delay
- processing delay
- queuing delay

bits per second (bps)
bytes per second (Bps)

CDN's allow you to reduce the propagation time of network packets

`traceroute` is a simple network diagnostic tool that tells you the routing path of a packet and the latency of each network hop in an IP network

a **codec** is device or computer program for encoding or decoding a digital data stream or signal

TCP and IP

HTTP does not require that TCP be used as the transport protocol

## TCP

All TCO connections begin with a three-way handshake

Why is this three-way handshake necessary?
