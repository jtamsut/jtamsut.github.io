I am a professional software engineer. I didn't major in computer science. I write
code every day . One of things I realized I don't know enough of is how computers work
on a fundamental level. How does code get read by a computer? How does an operating kernal work?
What are processes? These are all questions that have organically arisen in the last six months.

These questions all expose a gap in my knowledge. Working full-time as a sofware engineer it is
difficult to make the time to learn these things. Possible yet difficult. I want to develop a
system that enables me to consistently learn a complex topic in pieces in several months using my free
time. I want to make a habit where habits are difficult to form.

I want to learn more about the shell. It is an important tool that every programmer uses every day. It has
many utilities and is an important way we interact with computers. I also want to learn

I will begin with the Linux command line. I will read *The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction* by
William E. Shotts Jr.

I will then read *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan and Ritchie.

*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective* by Bryant and O'Halloran.

This is a total 1,872 pages. Let's talk about the projects and blog posts you will write about this.
